    <p>Hello everyone! This is the famous Hainanese Chicken Rice recipe!
      Hainanese chicken rice is a dish of poached chicken and seasoned rice, served with chilli sauce and usually with cucumber garnishes. 
      It was created by immigrants from Hainan in southern China and adapted from the Hainanese dishes of Wenchang chicken and Wenchang chicken rice.
      The chicken is incredibly silky. However, the rice is really what it's known for. Cooked in the broth from poaching the chicken, 
      served with some condiments.</p>
      
      <h2><b>Ingredients needed:</b></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>3 cups of Rice, chopped garlic (rice)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water, 1.25 ounces rock sugar (about 2 sizable chunks, or substitute 2.5 tbsp granulated sugar), 1/4 cup dark soy sauce (Sweet dark soy sauce)</li>
        <li>3 fresh red chilies (choose a chili with medium spice level), 1.5-inch piece ginger, 2 cloves garlic, 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon sugar, 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice (1 tbsp/15ml = the juice of 1/2 lime), 1/2 teaspoon rice vinegar (or white vinegar), 2 tablespoons broth from boiling the chicken (chili sauce)</li>
        <li>4-inch piece of ginger roughly chopped, 1 clove garlic, 3 tablespoons neutral oil (such as vegetable, canola, or avocado oil), 1 pinch of salt (ginger-garlic paste)</li>
        <li>scallions (chicken)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Let's start!</b></p>
        <p>Firstly wash the chicken clean and remember to set aside the piece of chicken fat.
           Transfer the chicken to a plate and pat dry with a paper towel. Lightly rub the chicken with the salt.</p>

           Boil ginger and scallions in a large stockpot of water.

           Lower the chicken into the boiling water, positioning the chicken breast-side up.
           Adjust the water level so the chicken breast just pokes above the water (so you aren't left with dry white meat).
           Wait for the water to come to a boil again. Once it does, carefully lift the chicken out of the water to pour out the colder water that is trapped in the cavity. Lower the chicken back into the pot afterwards.

           When it is starting to boil, turn the heat down. Keep it at barely a simmer. There should be very little movement in the water, but it also shouldn't be still. Cover the pot, and keep the heat around the lowest setting so the liquid continues to simmer slowly. (30-35 minutes, roughly 10-11 minutes per pound). To check if the chicken is done, stick a toothpick into the thickest part of the thigh until it touches the bone. If the juices run clear, it's cooked through.
           Prepare a large ice bath. Once the chicken is cooked, carefully lift the chicken out of the pot, drain the water from the cavity and lower it into the ice bath. Take care not to break the skin.

           After 15 minutes in the ice bath, drain completely and cover with clear plastic until ready to cut and serve. The ice bath stops the cooking process, locks in the juices, and gives the chicken skin better texture.

           Heat a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken fat, along with 1 teaspoon of oil, and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until you have about 1 tablespoon of rendered fat.

           Stir in the minced garlic and fry briefly, making sure it doesn't burn.

           Add the uncooked jasmine rice. Stir continuously for about two minutes.

           Turn off the heat. Scoop the rice into your rice cooker (leave the hunk of chicken fat behind or add it to the rice — your choice).
           Add the stock from poaching the chicken (instead of the usual water).
           Stir in the salt. Close the lid and press START.
